# image-lambda

This lambda runs automatically when an image is uploaded to my bucket's images folder.

A huge issue I encountered during deployment was in our instructions. Having four different lectures that each were incorrect or incomplete in different ways made piecing together the single "complete" project a royal pain. The concepts behind AWS are simple. The abstraction that AWS provides is not. I wish to fight Jeff Bezos at this point.
